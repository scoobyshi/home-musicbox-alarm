# Whole Home Wake-up Alarm for the Family
The idea of this project is to load and play the families favourite playlists, orchestracted either by a new web interface, or in the first phase by
a simple schedule (cron).  I wanted to re-purpose some computer speakers (which can sometimes be decent quality) paired with Raspberry Pi's to craft 
an "alarm" that triggers on a schedule, loads their favourite Spotify playlist(s) and gently raises the volume.  This could be extended to include
also the Wink API and slowly bringing up the lights in the same room.
